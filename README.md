### 🔨 Obstacle Assault – CPP (Work in Progress)

A third-person platformer built entirely with **C++ in Unreal Engine** — my first project focused on native code.

> Climb your way up a floating island by jumping across timed moving platforms. Each jump requires precise timing, as the platforms constantly rise and fall. Once you reach the top, the real challenge begins: avoid sliding cube blocks moving from both sides that try to knock you off the island.

This project is helping me solidify my understanding of **C++ within Unreal Engine**, especially around:
- object movement
- tick-based logic
- collision handling
- actor hierarchy
